# 👋 Hi, I'm mavic

I like to **build stuff** — ideas, tools, systems, experiments.  
Anything that mixes creativity, curiosity, and technology.

I've always been this way.  
When I was a kid (before cheap internet in India), I would buy toys, break them,  
modify them, and try to create something new — drones, flying ideas, robots in my head.  
No skills, no resources, just curiosity and imagination.

Years later, when internet finally reached us, I found YouTube.  
I saw tech creators building drones, robots, machines… and it clicked:  
**“I want to build things like this.”**  
But I still wasn’t skilled enough.

School wasn't great for me.  
I even failed 10th — got **1 mark in math**.  
Switched to commerce, passed 12th, then somehow landed in BCA.  
I had never touched a computer properly before.  
Programming made no sense at first.  
But during my final-year project, something changed.

I built a stock-analysis tool using Gemini API + a Hugging Face model.  
And for the first time, I realized:  
**“I can actually build things.”**  
Even if I used GPT to assist, I *understood* backend, frontend, APIs, models —  
and it opened the door.

After my exams ended on **27 March**,  
I started learning seriously — from absolute zero.

Since then, I’ve invested **700+ hours** into:
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Deep Learning  
- Math  
- Transformers  
- GenAI  
- On-device LLM experiments  
- Finetuning fundamentals  

Hands-on.  
No shortcuts.  
Just curiosity + building.

## 🔥 What I’m Doing Right Now
- Experimenting with **tiny LLMs** on real devices  
- Recreating **Transformer internals** in PyTorch  
- Exploring **GenAI ideas** through small prototypes  
- Making simple videos explaining concepts  
- Building my repos into structured labs (ml-labs, deep-learning-labs, experiments)
- Preparing long-term for **robotics & AGI** — my original childhood dream

## 🌱 What I Care About
- Learning by building  
- Curiosity over theory  
- Making things simple and visual  
- Creating things that feel like the future
