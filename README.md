# 👋 Hi, I'm mavic

I like to **build stuff** — ideas, tools, systems, experiments.  
Anything that mixes creativity, curiosity, and technology.

I'm the kind of person who learns by doing:  
breaking things, rebuilding them, understanding how they work,  
and then pushing them a little further than they were meant to go.

My interests blend together:
- **AI** — Transformers, tiny LLMs, finetuning, on-device experiments  
- **Engineering** — building things from scratch, both in software & (future) robotics  
- **Creativity** — inventing ideas, prototyping fast, exploring new concepts  
- **Philosophy & Reality** — how tech shapes the world, meaning, future, AGI  
- **Future tech** — drones, exosuits, autonomous systems (my long-term dream)

## 🔥 What I’m Doing Right Now
- Experimenting with **tiny LLMs** on physical devices (TinyMobileLLM)  
- Rebuilding **core Transformer internals** in PyTorch  
- Exploring **GenAI ideas** through fast prototypes  
- Creating **simple videos** explaining AI concepts  
- Structuring my repos into labs (ml-labs, deep-learning-labs, experiments)  
- Building a workflow that supports long-term goals in **robotics + AGI**

## 🌱 What I Care About
- Understanding things **end-to-end**  
- Making concepts **simple, visual, practical**  
- Staying **curious**  
- Creating things that feel like the **future**
